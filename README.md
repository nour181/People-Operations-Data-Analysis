# People-Operations-Data-Analysis

1.   Intro
Through the data provided, the attrition rate for employees is 16% of total employees (237 employees). Most of them are in the Research and Development Department and Sales Department; almost 50% of them are between 26 and 35 years old; most of them are holding bachelorâ€™s degrees; most of them are near their homes; and they travel rarely.

2.	Purpose and Problem
Attrition led to a high loss of employees' manpower and talents, so discovering the main causes and contributing factors and taking actions and making recommendations on them will help reduce company attrition.

Attrition increases for specific job roles (laboratory technician, sales executive, research scientist, sales executive), so we will dig deep into them to discover what the contributing factors are that led to high attrition.
